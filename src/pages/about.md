### Welcome!

Let's be honest, 'About Me' sections can be a bit dry. So, I'm borrowing a brilliant idea from Alison Wood Brooks (shout-out to the [Mel Robbins](google.com) podcast!) to spice things up. Here's the deal: two insights into my professional world, and two glimpses into what makes me tick personally. Let's dive in!

**At work,** my playground is at the intersection of human experience and planetary well-being. As a service design professional, I'm obsessed with making climate tech not just functional, but genuinely delightful and intuitive for everyone.

**Personally,** when I'm not busy making green solutions user-friendly, you can usually find me getting wonderfully muddy on a hiking trail or feeling the wind on my face cycling through scenic routes. And yes, I'm probably researching my next sustainable swap or zero-waste hack while I'm at it – my personal life is just as committed to the planet!
