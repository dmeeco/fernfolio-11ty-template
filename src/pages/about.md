**From Symptoms to Systems:** My journey in design began like many others—solving immediate problems, optimizing user flows, making interfaces more intuitive. But working with climate tech startups taught me something crucial: we were constantly treating symptoms while the underlying extractive systems remained unchanged.

That realization shifted everything. I stopped asking "How do we make this easier to use?" and started asking "Why does this system exist in its current form, and how might we redesign it entirely?"

**Approach:** I work at the intersection of systems thinking and regenerative design, combining four core disciplines: systems mapping, circular design, behavioral design, and service design. This integrated approach helps organizations move beyond optimizing extractive models to creating entirely new systems that work for all stakeholders—human and non-human alike.

Every project starts with understanding the complete system before designing solutions. This means mapping not just user journeys, but resource flows, stakeholder relationships, and unintended consequences that traditional design approaches often miss.

**Beyond the Work:** When I'm not working, you'll find me hiking or cycling. Being in nature constantly reminds me that the best systems already exist around us—we just need to learn from them.
