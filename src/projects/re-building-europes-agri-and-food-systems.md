## **Situation**  
*Context and background*  

Begin by anchoring the project in its broader landscape. Clarify the client, industry, and scope, emphasizing why the work mattered. For example, *"A government agency struggling with FOIA request backlogs"* (Example 5) or *"A digital freight service needing to differentiate in a competitive SME market"* (Example 3). Use concise visuals like ecosystem maps or stakeholder diagrams to illustrate complexity.  

## **Problem**  
*Challenge or goal...*

Articulate the core issue, whether a user pain point, business constraint, or systemic gap. Frame it as a question: *"How might we support diabetes patients in self-management?"* (Example 6) or *"How might a subscription service retain long-term users?"* (Example 4). Highlight urgency with metrics—e.g., *"75% user drop-out during registration"* (Example 1).  

## **Action**  
*Approach and methods...*  

Showcase your process with intentionality. Detail research (interviews, surveys), ideation (workshops, design games), and tools (Figma, Mural). Emphasize collaboration (e.g., *"Co-facilitated workshops across Europe"* in Example 10) and adaptability (e.g., remote work in Example 9). Use workflow diagrams or brainstorming snapshots to demonstrate rigor.  

## **Results**  
*Outcomes and solutions...*  

Quantify success (e.g., *"10% increase in click-through rates"* in Example 8) and visualize deliverables (prototypes, service blueprints). Balance tangible outputs (e.g., *"Two long-term service concepts"* in Example 3) with user-centric benefits (e.g., *"AI-driven sound personalization"* in Example 4).  

## **Knowledge**  
*Impact, learnings, and next steps...* 

Reflect on scalability (*"Pilot program expanded to 200 participants"* in Example 11) and lessons (*"Remote collaboration tools were critical"* in Example 12). Highlight how insights informed future work (e.g., *"Developed a concept development framework"* in Example 6). Use quotes from stakeholders or users to add authenticity.
