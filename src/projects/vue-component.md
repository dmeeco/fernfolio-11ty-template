**Building a User-Centric Platform**\
Earthpact's founder envisioned a platform connecting individuals and organizations with sustainable solutions. The initial database of 2400+ solutions lacked user accounts and matchmaking, hindering effective engagement. The challenge was to transform this into a dynamic, user-friendly platform that fostered collaboration and impact.

**Strategic Redesign and No-Code Innovation**\
I collaborated with the founder to strategize, build a team, and secure funding. We conducted user research, gathered feedback, and refined the branding. Leveraging no-code tools like Softr, Airtable, and Zapier, we developed key features: user sign-ups, wishlists, matchmaking automation, and user/business profiles.

**Rapid MVP Development and Beta Launch**\
Within six weeks, we launched an MVP, followed by a beta launch in ten weeks. The response was remarkable, with over 400 sign-ups in the first two weeks. We focused on freemium models and free credits to minimize overhead, planning for premium upgrades as we scaled.

**Enhanced User Experience and Engagement**\
Post-launch feedback led to improved data legibility and a streamlined signup process, reducing bounce rates and increasing conversion rates. The strategic redesign, executed with a lean team, was completed two weeks ahead of schedule and under budget, demonstrating efficient resource management.
