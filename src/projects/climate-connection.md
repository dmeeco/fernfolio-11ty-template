#### How do I edit content?

Once your site is deployed and configured, add `/admin` to the end of the url (not using localhost) and hit refresh. From there, you should be able to login and see see the content management dashboard. You should be able to change most content here (e.g. page text, images, logo, articles, projects, etc.).

If you want to take your customizations further, you will need to modify the project source code. Some customizations, like changing theme colors and fonts, are straightforward (those can be modified in the `variables.scss` file). Other customizations will require more in-depth solutions.
