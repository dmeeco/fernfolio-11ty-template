**Catalyzing Climate Action**\
Planet Possible aimed to transform complex climate science into actionable individual steps. My role as Senior Product Designer was to spearhead the redesign and enhancement of the platform, driving user engagement and measurable environmental impact from its nascent stages through to strategic acquisition.

**Strategic Onboarding and Foundational Discovery**\
Joining Planet Possible, I initiated intensive collaboration with the founder to redefine the product roadmap. This involved meticulous gathering of product requirements and conducting 1-1 discovery sessions with key stakeholders, including university partners and the Count-on-Us methodology team, to align vision and strategy.

**Integrating Robust Frameworks for Impact**\
A core challenge was translating established environmental frameworks into a compelling digital experience. I leveraged the Drawdown Framework and adapted the Count-on-Us methodology, devising novel techniques to integrate its principles effectively within the mobile application, ensuring actions were both meaningful and accessible.

**Leading MVP Design to Rapid User Adoption**\
I led the end-to-end design of the Minimum Viable Product, encompassing over 300 distinct actions. This foundational work was instrumental in achieving significant early traction, attracting 4,200 users who completed 8,100 actions within the first six months post-launch, validating the core concept.

**Enhancing Engagement through Behavioural Science**\
To deepen user commitment, I applied behavioural science principles to introduce sophisticated engagement features. This included the strategic implementation of gamification elements such as activity tracking and leadership boards, directly addressing user motivation and retention.

**Measurable Uplift in Key Performance Indicators**\
The integration of gamification yielded tangible results, significantly boosting Daily Active Users (DAU) and elevating 3-month retention rates. Furthermore, the development of community tracking features drove substantial Monthly Active User (MAU) growth and accelerated feature adoption within an 8-week period.

**Navigating Growth and Strategic Acquisition**\
Our success led to selection for a VC-funded Behaviour Challenge cohort, offering a platform to pitch for scaling investment. Concurrently, an independent opportunity led to the successful acquisition of Planet Possible by RipplEffect, where I supported the pivot by contributing to brand design changes and geo-tagging feature integration.
