#### **Situation**

*Context and background*  

Goodfind, an ethical shopping platform, sought to redesign its website to enhance user experience and secure funding. As the sole designer, I collaborated with the founder to translate complex sustainability requirements into a functional, minimalist interface. The project focused on connecting users with ethical brands while balancing investor needs and technical constraints.

#### **Problem**

*Challenge or goal...*

The existing platform lacked clarity in showcasing brand sustainability credentials and struggled with usability. Key challenges included integrating real-time product data, simplifying navigation for 23k+ users, and designing a scalable architecture under tight timelines. Stakeholders emphasized aligning the redesign with SDG-driven values without compromising aesthetic simplicity.

##### **Action**

*Approach and methods...*  

* **User Story Implementation**:

  * **Data Integration**: Addressed the product manager’s need for real-time pricing and certification updates by designing automated API calls to partner platforms (e.g., Shopify, Trustpilot).
  * **Referral System**: Embedded dynamic referral codes into product links, aligning with the user story: *“As a product manager, I need commission tracking.”*
  * **Sustainability Filters**: Prioritized user stories for filtering by certifications (e.g., Fair Trade, B Corp) and sorting by price, simplifying ethical decision-making.
  * **Partner Onboarding**: Streamlined brand/retailer registration workflows to eliminate technical barriers, addressing the story: *“As a partner, I want to join without a tech team.”*
* **Design Validation**:\
  Conducted A/B testing on search layouts (inspiration: Pricerunner) to optimize usability for the story: *“As a user, I want to save favorites and track history.”*
